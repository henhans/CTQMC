# CTQMC for practice
Continuous time monte carlo(CTQMC) for Anderson model segment update for practice. The only implemented observable is perturbation order. The output is the perturbation order histogram for each spin. At low temperature beta>500 the perturbation order historgram is distorted...probably need to add more update methods(global, antisegment)...debugging. 

Libraries:

    1.Eigen
    2.gsl
    3.openmp
